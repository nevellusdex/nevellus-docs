# How to Migrate Uniswap LP Tokens

Uniswap has terminated its token rewards-based liquidity provision program. In light of this, we are offering Uniswap LPs the opportunity to seamlessly and, more importantly, gas-efficiently transfer their liquidity pool from Uniswap to Nevellus to start earning governance tokens again. If you currently have any liquidity positions on Uniswap, this tutorial will show you how to quickly migrating them works!

### Migrating

**Step 1.** Head to [Nevellus Migrator](https://app.nevellus.com/migrate)

**Step 2.** Connect your wallet to Nevellus (make sure you have some Ethereum to cover gas fees!)

**Step 3.** Ensure that you have liquidity on Uniswap.

**Step 4.** Allow access to your Uniswap LP tokens on your selected wallet type.

**Step 5.** Select the tokens you wish to migrate and the amount.

**Step 6.** Click "Migrate"

**Step 7.** Approve the transaction in your wallet and youâ€™re all set!

_Please note that as with any liquidity providing execution, you are exposing yourself to impermanent loss risk. However, unlike Uniswap, Nevellus helps to offset some risk by offering $NVLS token rewards!_
