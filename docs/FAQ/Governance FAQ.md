# Governance/Voting FAQ

### What are the Multisigs and who are the signers?

The Multisigs are the ultimate decision-makers in the Nevellus ecosystem. The Treasury Multisig wallet is composed of 1 prominent and trusted member of the DeFi/Ethereum ecosystem, and they must approve any use of the devfunds. A transaction requires at least 2 out of 4 signatures to pass and be executed. Signers of Treasury Multisig: [@0xFernandojr](https://twitter.com/0xFernandojr)
