# Introduction

## What is Nevellus?

Nevellus is a decentralized financial platform built with the goal of offering the most complete investment products, such as Automated Market Maker. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, Nevellus intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.

Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here, include: a decentralized exchange, an AMM framework, Yield Farming and staking derivatives. Nevellus products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance of $NVLS token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy and overall development is ultimately decided on by our core team.

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of the ecosystem products, as well as customized tutorials to walk you through all of Nevellus exciting features!
