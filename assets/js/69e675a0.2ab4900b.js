For example, if you want to buy $NVLS tokens with $USDC, you will need to approve Nevellus's access to the USDC token by paying a small connection fee. As we mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, this fee, along with other fees on Ethereum, will need to be paid in Ether (ETH). So, in order to access the Nevellus platform, you will need ETH in your wallet to pay the fees. If you do not have any Ether, you will need to purchase some from a centralized exchange that services your region.
