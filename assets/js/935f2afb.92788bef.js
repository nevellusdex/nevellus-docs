Enceladus is a liquidity provision reward system for tokens that are relatively new. This means that tokens on the Enceladus menu are another potential source of yield farming for users. Tokens selected to be on the Enceladus Platform are given an allocation of $NVLS tokens per block to incentivize liquidity provision. The benefit to being on the Enceladus Platform is that the projects themselves aren\u2019t forced to incentivize their communities to provide liquidity for their tokens, because Nevellus does it for them. This eases the burden of impermanent loss, and decreases the price impact/slippage of individual purchases, making purchasing more cost efficient.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"Tutorials/How to Get Started on Nevellus/How to Add & Remove Liquidity":{"id":"Tutorials/How to Get Started on Nevellus/How to Add & Remove Liquidity","title":"How to Add & Remove Liquidity","description":"An exchange is a place to buy/sell tokens, but in order to do that, it needs one basic thing: tokens (otherwise known as liquidity). Traditionally, centralized exchanges, like Coinbase, provide and manage this liquidity. On Nevellus, the liquidity is provided voluntarily by its users. In return, Nevellus rewards those who provide temporary access to their tokens with a share of the 0.25% fee charged to traders of the respective token pair, proportional to the amount of liquidity they added to the pool. This option could be a great opportunity to earn extra yields on tokens that are just sitting in your wallet.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"Tutorials/How to Get Started on Nevellus/How to Earn Yield":{"id":"Tutorials/How to Get Started on Nevellus/How to Earn Yield","title":"How to Earn Yield","description":"Earning yield on Nevellus is connected to being a liquidity provider, but it is also different because you earn $NVLS token rewards.
